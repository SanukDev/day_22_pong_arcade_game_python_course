Tennis Game in Python

This Python code implements a simple yet fun tennis game using the Turtle graphics library. Players control paddles on either side of the screen to hit a ball back and forth. A scoreboard keeps track of the points for each player.

Files:

ball.py: Defines the Ball class, which represents the moving ball in the game.
padlle.py (typo corrected to paddle.py): Defines the Paddle class, which represents the controlled paddles on both sides.
scoreboard.py: Defines the Scoreboard class, which manages the scorekeeping and displays it on the screen.
main.py: The main game script that initializes the screen, objects, and game loop.

Controls:

Player 1 (Left Paddle): Use the w key to move the paddle up and the s key to move it down.
Player 2 (Right Paddle): Use the Up arrow key to move the paddle up and the Down arrow key to move it down.
